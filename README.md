## 🧐 What is this?

**Tinytosh** is a DIY project that fits a smart dashboard inside a tiny, 3D-printed Macintosh-style case. It connects to your WiFi to display useful information or hooks up to your PC via USB or Wi-Fi to show real-time hardware stats.

### Available Screens & Services
* 🕒 **Internet Clock:** Auto-syncs time and date based on your location.
* 📅 **Calendar:** Displays the current date and a full monthly grid.
* 🌤️ **Weather Station:** Live Temperature, Humidity, and Forecasts (via Open-Meteo). Choose a "With Header" or "No Header" layout, each with its own set of up to 3 or 6 selectable extra values (Feels Like, Humidity, Wind, Precipitation, Pressure, Visibility).
* 🍃 **Air Quality:** Monitor local AQI levels (US & EU Standards), with the same "With/No Header" layout choice and up to 3 or 6 selectable pollutant readings (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, CO2, SO2, Ozone, Dust, UV Index, Methane).
* ☀️ **Daylight Info:** Tracks sunrise, sunset, solar noon, and day length.
* 🌑 **Moon Info:** Tracks the current lunar phase, illumination percentage, and precise moonrise/moonset times with dynamically rendered graphics.
* 🌍 **Population Info:** Live dashboard displaying a second-by-second calculated world and country population ticker with annual growth rates.
* 🛩️ **Flight Radar:** Track nearby aircraft by callsign, altitude, speed, distance, track, type, or route. Switch between a live multi-aircraft **Radar** view or a dedicated **Closest Aircraft** dashboard, in Aviation (kt/ft) or Metric (km/h/m) units.
* 💱 **Currency Tracker:** Track exchange rates for **up to 5** fiat currency pairs with custom scaling multipliers.
* 🖥️ **PC Hardware Monitor:** Connects via **USB** or **Wirelessly** to your Windows/Mac/Linux computer to show CPU Load, RAM Usage, and Network Speeds in real-time!
* 🎧 **PC Media:** Displays currently playing track, artist, album, and playback status streamed directly from your connected computer.
* 🖨️ **Bambu 3D Printer:** Local network telemetry for your Bambu Lab printer (progress, temperatures, fans, and print status) featuring smart layouts for IDLE and PRINTING modes.
* 🖥️ **Screensaver:** Animated scenes that play one per visit: MacPaint drawing itself, a spinning wireframe Mac, Conway's Life, and a live-weather scene with rain, snow, or stars behind the temperature. Pick which scenes run in the Web Panel.
* 🕰️ **Mac Desktop Clock:** An optional style for the Time screen. The time sits in a System 1 window while a cursor drags it around and works the menu bar.

### ✨ Key Features
* **🍎 Classic Mac Look:** Every screen is drawn as a System 1 window, with a striped title bar, a close box, Mac progress bars and alert boxes. Pick **Window** or **Menu Bar** framing and **Black** or **White** paper in the Web Panel or PC App.
* **🧩 Modular Dashboard:** The heart of Tinytosh. Enable or disable any of the screens above to build exactly the device you want — a full 12-screen rotation, a dedicated clock, or anything in between. Toggle screens on/off instantly via the Web Panel or PC App, no reflashing required.
* **🎛️ Per-Screen Configuration:** It's not just *which* screens you show — it's *how* they look. Every screen has its own dedicated settings (units, minimal vs. full layouts, with/without header modes, full names vs. compact tickers, and more), so each one behaves exactly the way you prefer.
* **🎨 OLED Theme Engine:** Procedural design system. Pick 4 base colors, and the engine automatically calculates all hover states, UI borders, and muted text tones for both the Web Panel and PC app!
* **🔌 Hardware Setup:** Customize your I2C pinout, and choose whether your button is a Touch Sensor or a physical Switch (plus its GPIO pin), directly from the Web Panel without touching the code.
* **⚡ Instant Live Sync:** Change a setting on the Web Panel or PC App and watch it apply on the OLED right away — no reboots, no waiting, no manual refresh.
* **📍 Smart Location:** Auto-detect your location via IP or manually set your exact coordinates, country, and native timezone. *(Tip: for the most accurate Flight Radar results, enter your precise coordinates manually instead of relying on auto-detect.)*
* **🔀 Drag & Drop Reordering:** Fully customize your display sequence. Grab and drag screens to change their order. The configuration UI dynamically rearranges itself to match your custom layout perfectly.
* **👆 Button Controls:** Supports an optional TTP223 touch sensor *or* a physical momentary switch — just pick which one you wired in Hardware Setup. **Single Tap** to advance to the next screen (or wake the display), **Double Tap** to jump back to the previous one, and **Long Press** to lock/unlock auto-rotation to keep your favorite screen visible indefinitely.
* **👻 Smart Auto-Hide:** PC Monitor and PC Media screens can intelligently hide themselves and skip rotation when your PC is off, disconnected, or no media is playing.
* **⏱️ Custom Data Sync Intervals:** Override the global refresh rate on a per-screen basis. Set Weather, Air Quality, or Currency to sync more (or less) often than the rest of your dashboard.
* **🌙 Night Mode & Power Saving:** Set a quiet schedule to minimize sleep distractions. Choose between *Dim Display*, *Turn Display Off*, or *Dim then Turn Off* (featuring an extra time picker for gradual dimming). Features "Smart Latching" (waits for the primary screen before sleeping), 10x slower background API fetching to save power, and a temporary 30-second wake feature via the physical button.
* **🆓 Zero Config APIs:** Uses free public APIs. No API keys required.
* **🔒 Privacy First:** No accounts, no cloud tracking. Everything runs locally on the ESP32.

## 🛠️ The Software Stack

For developers, makers, and the curious, here is how the magic happens. The project consists of three distinct software parts:

### 1. Firmware (ESP32-C3)
*Written in C++ using the Arduino Framework.*

The firmware is designed to be **non-blocking** and **modular**.
* **🧱 Service-Oriented Architecture:** Firmware logic is split into focused, single-responsibility services (`DisplayService`, `TimeService`, `DataSyncService`, `HardwareService`, `NightModeService`, and more) instead of one monolithic sketch — keeping the codebase easy to read, extend, and hack on.
* **⚡ Async RTOS:** Employs background FreeRTOS tasks to fetch API data asynchronously. The display and animations stay buttery smooth at 60fps without ever freezing to download data.
* **⏱️ Granular Data Scheduling:** A dedicated `DataSyncService` tracks fetch timing independently per screen, so Weather, AQI, and Currency can each sync on their own custom interval instead of a single global timer.
* **🔄 Universal Config Sync:** The device uses a unified JSON configuration payload, allowing it to instantly accept and apply settings over the local Web Server or via the PC Serial/USB connection.
* **🌐 mDNS Support:** Easily access the device's Web Panel without memorizing IPs using its unique local domain (e.g., `http://tinytosh-ab12.local`).
* **🔐 Hardware Pairing Lock:** Telemetry streams are protected. Tinytosh securely pairs to the active PC to ensure multiple computers on the same network don't fight over the display.
* **🧰 UI Library & Screen Registry:** `Ui.h` draws the Mac frame, fonts and widgets, and gives every screen the same 124x52 canvas. Each screen is one `Screen*.cpp` file plus one row in the `SCREENS` table in `Screens.cpp`, so adding a screen touches no navigation or rendering code. `tools/ui-harness/run.sh` draws every screen in every style on your computer and fails if a pixel leaves the panel.
* **🖼️ Dynamic Rendering:** The `DisplayService` handles the OLED. It supports "partial screen buffering," allowing for complex transition effects (like dissolving pixels or sliding curtains) without needing a massive frame buffer.

#### 🏗️ Build & Compile Guide

**Web Installer: No Coding Required**

This is the fastest way to get started. You do not need to install VS Code, Arduino, or any drivers.
1.  Connect your ESP32-C3 to your computer via USB.
2.  Open the **[Tinytosh Web Installer](https://vladimirgitsarev.github.io/Tinytosh/)** in a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave).
3.  Click **"Connect"** and select your device from the list.
4.  Click **"Install Tinytosh"** to flash the latest firmware automatically.

You can build this project using **PlatformIO** (VS Code) or the **Arduino IDE**.

**Option A: PlatformIO** This is the "Gold Standard" as it manages dependencies automatically. Simply open the project in VS Code and copy the following into your `platformio.ini`:

```ini
[env:esp32-c3-supermini]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32-c3-devkitm-1
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
board_build.partitions = huge_app.csv
build_unflags = -std=gnu++11
build_flags = 
    -std=gnu++17
    -D ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1
    -D ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT=1
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager.git
    bblanchon/ArduinoJson @ ^6.21.0
    adafruit/Adafruit SSD1306 @ ^2.5.7
    adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library @ ^1.11.5
    adafruit/Adafruit BusIO @ ^1.14.1
    mathertel/OneButton @ ^2.5.0
    knolleary/PubSubClient @ ^2.8
```

**Option B: Arduino IDE** If you prefer the Arduino IDE, you must install the external libraries manually via the Library Manager (`Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries...`).:

| Library Name | Author | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WiFiManager** | *tzapu* | Captive portal for WiFi setup |
| **ArduinoJson** | *Benoit Blanchon* | Parsing API data and settings |
| **Adafruit SSD1306** | *Adafruit* | Driver for the OLED screen |
| **Adafruit GFX Library** | *Adafruit* | Core graphics and text support |
| **OneButton** | *Matthias Hertel* | Touch button handling and long presses |
| **PubSubClient** | *Nick O'Leary* | MQTT client for Bambu Lab printer telemetry |

> ⚠️ **Important:** When installing `Adafruit SSD1306`, the IDE may ask if you want to install dependencies like **"Adafruit BusIO"**. Click **"Install All"** to ensure the screen works correctly.

**Note on Built-in Libraries:** The following libraries are required but **do not** need to be installed separately. They are included in the ESP32 Board Package:
* `WiFi.h` & `WiFiServer.h`
* `WiFiClientSecure.h`
* `HTTPClient.h`
* `Preferences.h`
* `Wire.h` (I2C)
* `time.h`
* `ESPmDNS.h`

> ⚠️ **Partition Scheme:** The firmware is about 1.6 MB, which is larger than the default 1.2 MB app slot. In the Arduino IDE choose **Tools → Partition Scheme → Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)** before compiling, or the build stops with *"text section exceeds available space in board"*. Tinytosh keeps its settings in NVS and does not use OTA updates or a filesystem, so nothing is lost. The PlatformIO config above already sets this with `board_build.partitions`. To rebuild the web installer image from the command line, run `tools/build-firmware.sh`.

### 2. PC Bridge App (Desktop)
*Written in Rust 🦀 & Tauri.*

To display PC statistics (CPU/RAM/Net) and manage device settings, the ESP32 uses a lightweight helper app running on the computer.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
* **Dynamic UI Rendering:** The PC app dashboard physically mirrors your device! Configuration panels automatically reorder themselves in real-time to match the exact screen sequence you set on your Tinytosh.
* **Wireless Telemetry (mDNS):** The PC app automatically discovers Tinytosh devices on your local network. You can broadcast your PC's hardware stats completely wirelessly!
* **Smart Connection Fallback:** The app constantly monitors your hardware and instantly prioritizes a wired USB connection for maximum stability. Yank the USB cable? The app instantly and silently falls back to Wi-Fi to keep the data flowing with zero hesitation.
* **Native Telemetry:** Fetches system stats directly from the OS kernel—no third-party bloatware (like AIDA64) required.

**Build it yourself:**
```bash
cd TinytoshPC
npm install
npm run tauri build
```

### 3. Browser Simulator (Wokwi)
*A standalone, hardware-free build of the display logic.*

The [`TinytoshSimulator`](TinytoshSimulator/) folder is a simplified [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) simulation — no WiFi, no API calls, no settings panel, just realistic mock data driving the exact same `Config` struct and screen-drawing code as the real firmware. It's the fastest way to see every screen, layout option, and button gesture in action without owning any hardware.

[**🛰️ Try it on Wokwi**](https://wokwi.com/projects/452257384760576001) or run it locally — see [`TinytoshSimulator/README.md`](TinytoshSimulator/README.md) for setup.
